## Abstract
We decided that the best neighborhood is the healthiest neighborhood. We combined three data sets: median death rates, obesity rates, and Covid-19 cases and deaths. Using a point system, we combined the four metrics we created into one metric to decide which neighborhood in Allegheny County is the BEST neighborhood.
